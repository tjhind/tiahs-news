# Tiah's News Frontend Application

Welcome!

This project is a summary of everything I learnt during the frontend portion of the Northcoders' bootcamp.

This is a front-end React application which connects to the backend API that I built previously ([view it by clicking on this link](https://github.com/tjhind/nc-news)) to aggregate news articles, topics, and comments from a database. For styling (still under construction), I used a mix of the MUI react component library and CSS.
There is functionality for the user to interact with the database, such as inserting and deleting new comments, and being able to up/downvote articles. Users can also seamlessly sort through articles to only view articles of a certain topic, as well as being able to sort the articles by date, votes, comment count, author, and title.

### [Hosted version: take a look!](https://tiahsnews.netlify.app/)

_may be slow to load on first access due to spinning down after inactivity_

### Or to clone the repo:

**PLEASE NOTE:**

In order to run this API, you will need to have installed [**Node.js and NPM**\*](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

\* >= V21.5.0 & V10.2.4 respectively

**SETUP**

**1. Clone the repository & install dependencies**

To clone the repo you'll need to have a local version of [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed.

1. In your terminal, run the following:
   `git clone https://github.com/tjhind/tiahs-news`
   `cd tiahs-news`
   And then open the repo in your favourite code editor.

2. Run `npm run dev` to run the app. This should connect to your local server and allow you to host the application.

**Enjoy! Please feel free to share any feedback by raising an issue on github or sending me a message.**
